There’s a big fight in “Mexican Republic” tonight! Mexican William “El Camarón” Zepeda (32-0-0) defense his championship belt against American Tevin “American Idol” Farmer (33-7-1) in a highly-anticipated rematch for the WBC lightweight title on Saturday, Mar. 29.

William Zepeda vs. Tevin Farmer 2 is on March 29. The main card starts at 8 p.m. ET. Zepeda and Farmer should make their way to the ring around 11 p.m. ET, depending on how long the undercard fights last.

The main event was made official when WBC interim lightweight champion William Zepeda (32-0, 27 KOs) and challenger Tevin Farmer (33-7-1, 8 KOs) hit the scales and weighed in under and at the lightweight division limit of 135 pounds. The drama was earlier when Marlen Esparza (15-2, 1 KO) came in overweight (1.4 pounds over) for her fight flyweight fight against Yokasta Valle (32-3, 10 KOs). It’s the third time in a row that Esparza has come overweight, and there has to be a thought that either she has to move up in weight or retire from the sport, which she has mentioned in years past. The fight will move forward as something was negotiated, but how this will affect Esparza tomorrow night will be the question leading up to their fight.

William Zepeda has no losses in his career so far and is able to progress due to his age. He almost always wins by knockout, and the average fight lasts 4.5 rounds. The Mexican fights frequently (he fought three fights last year alone), he is ranked fifth in The Ring's lightweight rankings, and the only thing that worries his fans is a recent left hand injury (and he is left-handed) that forced him to pull out of his fight with Shakur Stevenson.

Zepeda (32-0) had wins against Joseph Diaz and Maxi Hughes before facing Farmer (33-7-1) in November. Both landed 33% of their total punches. Zepeda threw 191 more punches and landed 66 more. Farmer knocked Zepeda down in the fourth, but the latter did enough to secure a split decision win.

Representing the host country, Zepeda (32-0, 27 KOs) defends the belt he claimed by split decision last November in their first fight. Former super featherweight champion Farmer (33-7-1, 8 KOs) of Philadelphia, who scored a knockdown on his opponent in the fourth round, looks to avenge the defeat.

Tevin Farmer is a former IBF featherweight champion and he still doesn't agree with the judge's decision in the first fight. Now he will have a great opportunity to prove his case, but he again, as then, in the eyes of the bookmakers goes as an underdog.

Still, it seems that Farmer has had his best fights, he is now 34 years old, and his conditioning is clearly not enough to take out championship fights. William Zepeda for him was and will remain the most serious opposition in his career, and to interrupt his series of two defeats, we believe that Tevin Farmer is unlikely to be able to.

The co-main event is a 12-round world championship bout between Puerto Rican Oscar Collazo (11-0, 8 KOs) of Newark, NJ and Edwin Cano Hernandez (13-2-1, 4 KOs) of Mexico. Collazo puts his unified WBA and WBO minimumweight belts on the line, while Cano makes his first attempt to become champion.
