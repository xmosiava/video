Boxing fans around the world will hope that Saturday’s clash is a repeat of September’s fight, which was arguably the best boxing match of 2024. The match’s environment was intensified with accusations of pre-match antics by Mayer’s team, and British fighter Ryan will be itching to take revenge on her opponent.

Betrayal in that Mayer’s longtime trainer Kay Koroma was released by Mikaela due to him working with Ryan, she did so because he knew she aspired to one day move up to the welterweight and eventually challenge the champions in that division. Champions that would include Ryan. She felt betrayed and released him. She hired former boxer Kofi Jantuah and believes that because of his training, he is now a much better boxer. There was hatred in that Ryan believed the paint attack she suffered on fight night was caused by Mayer’s team.

The culprits have yet to be identified, and it’s still unknown who exactly was behind the attack. Ryan appeared somewhat phased when the incident occurred and fought angrily during the early rounds. The match itself was an action-packed war where both fighters threw 1,203 punches combined. It was a close match, with Mikaela winning by majority decision. In the rematch, they appear to be set to pick up where they left off. At yesterday’s weigh-in, they had a very intense face-off where neither one would give an inch, standing nose to nose.

Ryan (7-2-1) lost the belt following a Fight of the Year contender. The Derby-born fighter was attacked outside her hotel, getting red paint thrown on her before the fight. Despite the drama, Ryan continued on, impressing in a losing effort.

Mayer (20-2) is a former IBF and WBO super featherweight champion. After cutting ties with Kay Koroma, who would train Ryan for this fight, the Golden Gloves champion won welterweight gold in her second attempt. She has denied taking part in the paint incident.

These two women do not like one another and are ready to use that animosity as motivation in the ring. After months of back and forth, the time for talk is over.

"She thinks she's so tricky. We know that's how she is. We know she's going to say that because she doesn't like to engage anyway, and neither does her coach," Mayer said. "Her coach wants to hide and stay in the shadows, and he's probably telling her, 'Don't engage.'

"I'm just doing what I have to do. I don't do anything but speak the facts, and I'm doing my part to sell this fight. Everyone is coming together and working hard to give her the rematch that she wanted. The least she can do is show up and help the promotion of this fight."

"You can see she loves the attention, the talk. When you don't give her that, it triggers her," Ryan said. "So, she's saying, 'Oh, she's scared.' I'm not scared. We just did a face-off. This is for the media. This is what's in the contract, and we're here. She loves to talk and loves the media. When you don't give her that, it makes her talk all kinds of nonsense."
Mayer found herself on the right end of a close decision, winning by majority decision to take the WBO welterweight title from Ryan at The Theater at Madison Square Garden on Sept. 27. Waleska Roldan scored the bout 97-93 and Benoit Roussel had it 96-94 in favor of Mayer, while Bob Williams had it a draw at 95-95.
