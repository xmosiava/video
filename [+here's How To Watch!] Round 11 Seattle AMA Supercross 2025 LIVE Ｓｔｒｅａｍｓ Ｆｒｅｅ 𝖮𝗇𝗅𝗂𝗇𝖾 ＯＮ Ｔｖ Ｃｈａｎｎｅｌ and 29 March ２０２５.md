Monster Energy AMA Supercross is back in action on Saturday in Seattle, Washington for round 11 of the championship.


Supercross 2025 Round 11 in Seattle: How to watch Saturday’s West Coast race, start times, schedule.


Round 11 of the Monster Energy Supercross Series heads to the Pacific Northwest and Lumen Field in Seattle, Washington, with a tight battle between Cooper Webb and Chase Sexton heating up.


In anticipation of rain during the course of the weekend in Seattle, this week’s Yamaha Animated Track map features an altered layout for Round 11 of the Monster Energy Supercross season at Lumen Field.


We’re heading back to the West Coast for the eleventh round of the 2025 Supercross series as we head to Seattle. Last weekend Chase Sexton was able to grab the win and inch his way closer to the Championship leader Cooper Webb. The two riders have begun to stretch their lead over the rest of the pack as Ken Roczen is battling a shoulder injury and has lost points the last few weekends. We are also heading back to the 250 West division where Haiden Deegan is the current points leader followed by Julien Beaumer. Haiden Deegan has begun to stretch his lead in the last few rounds and is looking to capitalize again in Seattle.

Webb finished sixth overall last week in the Triple Crown format race in Birmingham, Alabama, while Chase Sexton won and cut the points differential in half. Suddenly, Webb is the one in a position to do damage control; Sexton needs to sustain momentum. This race will set the tone for the upcoming East Coast swing.
